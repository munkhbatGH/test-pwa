# CHANGELOG

> April 09, 2025\_

- Version 3.5.2
- feat: Upgraded to latest Nextjs 15.5.2 and updated related deps
- Removed prettier-plugin-tailwindcss and added eslint-plugin-better-tailwindcss for linting and formatting

> Aug 24, 2025 â€” Version 3.5.0

- refactor: full codebase rebuilt from scratch on Next.js 15.5.0  
  â€¢ leaner bundle (â‰ˆ 15 % smaller) and faster cold starts (â‰ˆ 18 % quicker)
- chore: upgraded every dependency to latest stable release â€” zero unresolved peer-dep warnings
- build: switched to flat ESLint config; added carefully-curated rules & performance tweaks
- feat: integrated ts-parser, react-hooks-extra plugin & eslint-security-plugin for higher-value linting without bloat
- feat: Prettier now auto-sorts ES module imports and Tailwind utility classes
- feat: enabled ts-sort-suggestions for smarter IntelliSense (no more rogue `lucid-react` when importing `Link` from `next/link`)
- chore: dropped `cz-git`; conventional commits still supported via native tooling
- chore: updated `.vscode/settings.json` to discourage deprecated `next/router` imports and provide a zero-config DX out of the box

ðŸš€ Heads-up: the upcoming **v4** major release will introduce an installation-time customization wizard â€”Â get ready! ðŸ”¥
